## Overview

This console-based application simulates an online shopping system where users can select products, specify their region, and view a summary of their purchase. The program is written in C and was developed as a project for the Foundations of Programming course during the second semester at Universidade Veiga de Almeida.

## Features

- **Product Selection:** Users can choose products from a predefined list, each with a unique code, name, price, and weight.
- **Region Selection:** Users are prompted to select their region (North, Northeast, South, or Southeast) to calculate shipping costs.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Shipping costs are calculated based on the selected region and the weight of the products in the user's cart.
- **Purchase Summary:** After product and region selection, the program displays a comprehensive summary of the purchase, including selected products, prices, and delivery information.
